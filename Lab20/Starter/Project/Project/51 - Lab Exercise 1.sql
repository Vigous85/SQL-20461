---------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Task 3
-- 
-- Write a SELECT statement against the sys.tables view to show all user-defined tables. Retrieve the same columns as in task 2, but use the system function SCHEMA_NAME with the schema_id column. Use the alias schemaname to display the name of the schema.
